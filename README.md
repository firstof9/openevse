<br>
You probably do not want to do this! Use the HACS method above unless you know what you are doing and have a good reason as to why you are installing manually
<br>
  
1. Using the tool of choice open the directory (folder) for your HA configuration (where you find `configuration.yaml`).
2. If you do not have a `custom_components` directory (folder) there, you need to create it.
3. In the `custom_components` directory (folder) create a new folder called `openevse`.
4. Download _all_ the files from the `custom_components/openevse/` directory (folder) in this repository.
5. Place the files you downloaded in the new directory (folder) you created.
6. Restart Home Assistant
7. In the HA UI go to "Configuration" -> "Integrations" click "+" and search for "openevse"

## Configuration is done in the UI
